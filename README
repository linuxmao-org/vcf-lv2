This is a port to LV2 of Matthias Nagorni's VCF LADSPA plugins,
written by James Morris <james@jwm-art.net>

------------------------------------------------------------
To build:

make

To install for all users, system wide:

sudo make install-system

To install for just your user:

make install-user

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:

This is a beta release of the LV2 VCF plugins, and as such
is subject to change in future. The LV2 URI for each
plugin is not yet stable - depending on how much interest in
this comes from the original developer, the URI may change
completely. It is suggested that before installing a future
version, you therefor un-install this version.

Some of the filters work differently in Ardour2 than in
lv2rack and ingen. I don't yet know if this is my fault or
not... They seem to work correctly in the latter two hosts
( I think ).
